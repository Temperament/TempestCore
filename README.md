# TempestCore
TempestCore is an Open Source Emulator for S4 League.

Currently based on an older emulator, known as FagNet. 
FagNet was last updated in 2013, this project will hopefully revive the emulator and build up on it.

Written in C#.

TODO LIST:
-----

Rewrite Auth/Game/Relay/Chat servers to support using one configuration file, rather than a split 4.
